# SuperGlue Reimplementation Project

## Overview
This repository contains my personal attempt at re-implementing the SuperGlue architecture, as described in the paper "SuperGlue: Learning Feature Matching with Graph Neural Networks" by Paul-Edouard Sarlin, Daniel DeTone, Tomasz Malisiewicz, and Andrew Rabinovich (Link: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Sarlin_SuperGlue_Learning_Feature_Matching_With_Graph_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf). This project is an educational endeavor to deepen my understanding of advanced feature matching techniques in computer vision and graph neural networks.

SuperGlue represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision, particularly in the area of feature matching. It leverages the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms to establish correspondences between points in different images. This technology is pivotal in various applications, including 3D reconstruction, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and augmented reality.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to recreate the SuperGlue architecture from the ground up. This includes developing the attentional graph neural network, implementing the keypoint encoder, and utilizing the Sinkhorn algorithm for optimal matching. The project is structured to reflect the original paper's methodology while also incorporating my interpretations and learnings.

### Key Features
- Attentional Graph Neural Network implementation for understanding relationships between keypoints.
- Keypoint encoder to combine visual appearance and location information.
- Optimal matching layer with score prediction and the Sinkhorn algorithm.
